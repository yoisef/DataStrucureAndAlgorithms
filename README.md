This Repository Implement DataStructure And Algorithms With Generic Types

This repository contains:
=========================
# LinkedList

a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.
And has these types :-
 -Single
 -Doubly
 -Circlue

# Stack And Queues 

Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.

# Binary Search 

is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log n).

# Binary Search Tree 

s a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
